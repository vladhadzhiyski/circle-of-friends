Problem: How big is your circle?

Scenario: There are  N  people and  M  relationships of the form  x y , which means that person  x  and person  y  are friends. If two people are not direct friends, if there is a mutual friend, then they are considered indirect friends. Your job is to build a task to return the total of friends (direct + indirect) of each person by processing the input file.

Restraint:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ M ≤ 105
1 ≤ x,y ≤ N

Input:
The first line consists of two integers  N  and  M  denoting the total people and the total relationships respectively. The next  M  lines consists of two integers  x  and  y  denoting that person  x  and person  y  are direct friends.  x  and  y  can never be equal and there will be no duplicated relationship.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4 3
4 3
2 4
2 3

SAMPLE OUTPUT: 0 2 2 2

For the sample test case above:
- There are 4 people a nd 3 relationships
- Person 1 has no friends.
- Person 2’s total friends are 2 (3 and 4)
- Person 3’s total friends are 2 (2 and 4)
- Person 4’s total friends are 2 (2 and 3)
